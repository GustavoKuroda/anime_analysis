The Story of Cinderella,"Animation, Adventure, Drama",7.3,190,24 min,(1996),"The Story of Cinderella opens as Cinderella's life changes for the worse when her father leaves on a business trip. No sooner is he out of sight than Cinderella's stepmother has unceremoniously moved her two own daughters into Cinderella's room, thrown out her things, handed her a servant's dress, and put her to brutal harsh menial labor. The series covers Cinderella's trials and tribulations as she tries to adapt to her new life while suffering the abuse of her stepmother and her two stepsisters. All the while, her fairy godmother, Paulette, subtly watches her and tries to influence events to fix Cinderella's life without her noticing. One of her first acts in this is to grant several of the animals of the house the power of speech, thus giving Cinderella companions in her dog Patch, a pair of mice named Chuchu and Bingo, and a bird named Pappy. The animals provide her company as well as help with her chores. The biggest twist in the series is that Cinderella meets her Prince Charming early - except here he's the roguish Prince Charles, who has a habit of sneaking out of the castle and meets Cinderella by accident while disguised as a commoner. The two have a few misunderstandings before becoming friends and start having adventures together. Meanwhile, the villainous Duke Zaral plots against the royal family throughout the story, at times working Cinderella into his plots and machinations. The series eventually culminates in the ball in which the fairy tale ends, but with its own unique twist.","Pietro Ubaldi,Elisabetta Spinelli,Federica Valenti,Manuela Tamietti",,,190,0,,1996,No

Cyborg Sakura,"Animation, Action, Adventure",,,30 min,(1992–1993),"Cyborg Sakura is a futuristic anime series set in the city of Tokyo (Los Angeles in the American dubbed version). It follows the story of Kyoko Sakura, a cyborg with money problems (she spends too much money on clothes). Sakura has constant conflicts between her two love interests, Nogoro-san, a fly-by-night detective investigating an underground go-cart racing gambling cartel (who incidentally lives with his grandmother who is also an important character), and Hikaru Reza Hikari (Hikaru LaZer-Lite in the American dubbed version), a go-cart enthusiast and cybernetic mechanic. Although as the series begins, Sakura and Hikaru appear to be in a relationship, it becomes strained at points and Sakura waffles between her affections for both Nogoro-san and Hikaru. Another plot, which was never fully explored as the series was canceled before details could be revealed, is that of Sakura's search for her father, whom she suspects is the mysterious vigilante and sometimes villain, the Bladinator (who is named in the credits but never actually referred to as such during the show itself. The Bladinator is seen in the opening scene of the series shaking down a street vendor who is unable to pay his protection money to the Yakuza. For this, the Bladinator insists that the street vendor pay the blood price instead; after hearing this, the street vendor commits sepukku. The Bladinator is often referred to as ""the mysterious man in the shadows"" throughout the series but makes very few appearances aside from silhouettes until the final episode of the series in which Sakura finally confronts the Bladinator himself.","Hiroyuki Kenjiro,Taketomo Minoru,Genji Shika,Otsuka Takeji",,,,0,,1992,No

Kinema No Yoru/Film Night,"Animation, Short",,,3 min,(1986 Video),"The first almost entirely ""animated"" work within the oeuvre of Peter Callas, ""Kinema No Yoru"" introduces the motif of the menko playing card as a recurrent symbol.

Disjunctive images of war and territorial conquest (human bombs, brave feats, gas masks) thus convey more about Japan's colonial aspirations than of the game's competitive nature in the simple winning and losing of the iconic cards. The introduction of political and propagandist imagery reflects the artist's profound skepticism toward notions of universal truth and authenticity of experience.",,,,,0,,1986,No
