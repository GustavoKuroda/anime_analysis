# Overview
An analysis of Japanese Anime: An In-Depth IMDB Data Set.

# Summary
This repository gathers a Jupyter notebook and an interactive dashboard, analyzing a dataset of Japanese animes. The Jupyter Notebook makes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Time-Series Analysis using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib, plotly, and wordcloud for data visualization. The dashboard allows users to visualize and filter the data by various criteria. The chosen technology to build up the dashboard was Streamlit, an open-source Python library which allows the creation of custom web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science.
